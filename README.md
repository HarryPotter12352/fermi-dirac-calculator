# fermi-dirac-calculator

A script written in C++ to compute the various Fermi-Dirac quantities for a given species.

While writing these scripts, I try to use my own functions as much as I can, all the way to basic numerical integration. I resort to using the MATLAB engine for symbolic integration.
